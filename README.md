Which macro?
--------------------
Many people play games and use macros through android emulators.
Especially, lots of macros are operating based on **image search** and these macros cause great financial damage to game makers and companies.
So I wanted to attach it to an Android emulator to create a module that could prevent these macros.


HOW??
-------------------
Most macros with image search function are usually operated using **AHK or openv**.
So while searching for macro that contain this function, i found dll that user created their own for make easier to use in AHK.
